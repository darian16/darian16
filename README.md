**I'm proud that my work experience has led me to enjoy working within multidisciplinary teams. It has also given me a background in electronics, graphic design, marketing, and education technologies. I have held engineering, leadership, and academic positions in five countries, so I'm very versatile and enjoy embracing new challenges in my growth path.**
